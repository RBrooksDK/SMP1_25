<h1 align="center">Prerequisites</h1>

Students taking the course are expected to have basic mathematical skills (e.g. from IT-DMA1 or IT-MSE1). The course is designed to be self-contained, but it is recommended that students have a basic understanding of the following topics:

### Material

[Session material](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rib_viauc_dk/En0s5AGeHABFl6Vb0SaGndwBNjmoxJ3-CbjwXURoX7xScQ?e=fiKF5a)

### Topics

Most of the topics can be found in our course [Mathematics for Software Engineers (MSE)](https://rbrooksdk.github.io/MSE1/). I have written a [book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9eidJb5qtlZgvHCtqu4uuPa5FFU0Zpn/view?usp=sharing) for that course, and it covers the topics quite well. The references below are to the slides found in the material above as well as the book chapters that also correspond to the MSE course sessions.

#### Boolean Algebra
- Ch. 4
- Similar to sets, so all rules also apply for sets
- Addition is same as union, multiplication the same as intersection and negation same as complement
- Important: Slide 12 about identities

#### Sets
- Ch. 5
- Basic understanding of sets
- Important: Equivalence slide 29
- You should have also gone through this in DBS1

#### Combinatorics
- Ch. 5
- All rules are important, and I assume you know them
- The most used one is combinations on slide 12
- Important: Formulas Slide 12

#### Probability 1 + 2 (2.3 = Probability 2 slide 3)
- Ch. 5-6
- All rules of probability
- Important: Union 1.13, Conditional 2.2, Independence 2.3, Intersection 2.6, Law of Total Probability 2.8, Bayesâ€™ Theorem 2.10, Contingency Table 2.12, Joint Probability 2.14

#### Sequences and Summation:
- Appendix A
- The important part is Series from slide 19 onwards, not so much sequences (slides 1-18)
- Convergence slide 23
- Closed form formulae for series slide 24
- Useful summations and closed form slide 25
- Changing limits slide 26

#### Matrix Algebra:
- Ch. 7-9
- Basic understanding of matrices
- Using matrices for solving systems of equations
- Inverse matrices
- Matrix exponentiation

In Lesson 3, you will need to brush up on integrals. It seems that Khan Academy has some nice tutorials on integrals that you may want to check out: 
[Connecting the First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-7/v/connecting-the-first-and-second-fundamental-theorems-of-calculus), 
[Antiderivative of x + 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-integration-new/ab-6-8b/v/antiderivative-of-x-1), 
and
